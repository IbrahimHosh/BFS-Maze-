Program does three things. Creates a randomly generated maze of size n * m and returns a maze object. Prints out the randomly generated maze to user friendly visual representation. Lastly, it uses stacks and queues to implement Breadth-first search and shows the correct path to solve the maze.

To make program run in main. create Type maze object by using make maze.
For example.  
public static void main(String[] args){
    MyMaze maze2 = makeMaze(5,20,0,4);
    maze2.solveMaze();
}
